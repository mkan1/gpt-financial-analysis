# QA for Financial Statements
This project aims to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT model to create an interface for financial statements. The project utilizes the FinQA dataset and code from EMNLP 2021 paper: "FinQA: A Dataset of Numerical Reasoning over Financial Data" to train a deep learning model that can answer questions related to financial statements.

## Dataset
The FinQA dataset contains over 5,000 financial statements from companies in the S&P 500. The dataset includes questions about financial statements, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. Each question is associated with a set of financial statements, which the model can use to find the answer.

## Model
The model used in this project is a fine-tuned GPT model. The GPT model is pre-trained on a large corpus of text and has shown impressive results in various NLP tasks. The model is fine-tuned using the FinQA dataset to create an interface for financial statements.

## Usage
The jupyter notebook contains all code needed to download and pre-process the dataset. In the future, this is where the model code will reside as well.
